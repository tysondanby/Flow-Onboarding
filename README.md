This is a basic program to demonstrate the phenomenon of leapfrogging vortex rings.

How to use:
1 Use a text editor to modify the parameters in "parameters.simple"
2 Run "Leapfrog.jl"
3 A file, "Leapfrog.gif" will be produced with the resulting animation.

Note: Please ensure that Leapfrog.jl and parameters.simple are both in the current working directory folder for Julia.

My report is also included as "Tyson Danby Vortex Leapfrogging.pdf" and also as "Tyson Danby Vortex Leapfrogging.tex"
